Recognize Country by Coin Image

## Problem Statement

After their gaming startup PlayDoom couldn’t garner funding in the Entrepreneurship Summit, the team of Bhadage, Bansal and Pandey decided to give up on their startup and go on a world trip to follow their passion of numismatics (collection of coins). They travel to various countries and collect coins of various denominations to add to their collection.

Now, they’ve hired a data scientist Madhup to create a tool to predict countries from their coin currencies, by making use of their marvellous coin collection.

Can you help Madhup with the tool?
